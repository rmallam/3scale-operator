# This patch add annotation to admission webhook config and
# the variables $(CERTIFICATE_NAMESPACE) and $(CERTIFICATE_NAME) will be substituted by kustomize.

# MutatingWebhookConfiguration has been commented as `kustomize build config/manifests` command failed.
# Needs to be commented out when admission webhooks for the mutating type is needed.
